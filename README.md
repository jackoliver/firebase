# YRGO Firebase Workshop

## Getting started

1. Clone/Fork this repo
2. Run `npm install` in the directory
3. Run `npx nx serve exercise-1` to start the first exercise.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

`npx nx serve exercise-1`

The aim of Exercise 1 is to introduce you to Firebase Authentication. We'll do a couple of straightforward tasks around authenticating and creating user accounts. Bonus points if we get time to set up OAuth Social logins.

### Exercise 2

`npx nx serve exercise-2`

The aim of Exercise 2 is to introduce you to Firestore, `collections`, and `documents`. You'll write and read data in real-time, using `useEffect` to set up a snapshot listener.

### Exercise 3

`npx nx serve exercise-3`

The aim of Exercise 3 is to deploy using Firebase. We'll set up a Firebase account together, use the Hosting functionality, and the Firebase CLI to deploy your first website.
